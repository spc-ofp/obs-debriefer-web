Observer Debriefing Web Application
===============

The Observer Debriefing Web Application is intended to allow for the entry
of trip debriefing in two scenarios:

1.  Electronic entry of existing debriefing worksheets
2.  Direct electronic entry of debriefing data

The web application is written in C# and uses Microsoft's MVC3 framework for the
presentation layer.  The data access layer uses Fluent NHibernate with a SQL Server
data store.
